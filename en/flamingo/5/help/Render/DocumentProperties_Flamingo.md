# <img src="../Image/DocumentPropertiesButton.png"/>Document Properties: Flamingo nXt
{: toc-title }

These settings apply to the current model only. There is a trade-off between the time required to complete a rendering, and the quality desired.


#### To change settings

 1. On the **Flamingo nXt** menu, click **Document Properties**.

## Materials
{: .toc-header }


### Use materials
{: .toc-header }

Renders using materials created in Flamingo nXt and Rhino materials. Objects that have no material assignment render white.


### Use object color
{: .toc-header }

Renders using the colors assigned through Rhino object or layer color.

 **Note** : Both **Use materials** and **Use object color** can be checked. In this case, objects that have materials assigned will use those materials. Other objects will render using their object or layer color.


## Bounces
{: .toc-header }


### Reflective
{: .toc-header }

Determines how many levels of reflections are permitted; in other words, how many times a light ray will reflect off objects. A setting of 0 disables reflections. Higher values cause longer rendering times.


### Refractive
{: .toc-header }

Determines how many levels of refractions are permitted; in other words, how many times a light ray will refract off objects. A setting of 0 disables refractions. Higher values cause longer rendering times.


### Indirect
{: .toc-header }

Determines how many levels of indirect light are permitted; in other words, how many times an indirect light ray will bounce off objects. A setting of 0 disables reflections. Higher values cause longer rendering times.


## Display in rendered viewports
{: .toc-header }

 **Note** : These settings only affect viewports using Rhino's Rendered display mode. To see these objects in a rendered image, use [Post Effects](Render_Window.html#PostProcessingWireframe).


### Curves
{: .toc-header }

Curves display in rendered viewports.


### Dimensions and text
{: .toc-header }

Dimensions and text display in rendered viewports.


### Isocurves
{: .toc-header }

### Mesh edges
{: .toc-header }

Mesh edges display in rendered viewports.


## Miscellaneous
