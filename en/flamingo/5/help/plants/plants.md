# Plants
![plants-001.png](plants-001.png)
*Flamingo nXt trees.*
Flamingo nXt includes a fun and powerful plant generator that efficiently generates complex plant forms during rendering. These plants have little impact on model size, since only a placeholder is kept in the model.

##### Insert an nXt Plant
1. On the **Flamingo nXt** menu, click **Plants &gt; Insert Plant**.
1. In the **Flamingo nXt Plant** dialog box, click a plant name, and click **Open**.
1. At the prompt, pick a location for your plant in the model.

## Notes
> Make sure the units are set correctly for your model.
> Plants can be scaled, copied, and rotated.

##### Using Flamingo 2 plants
1. On the **Flamingo nXt** menu, click **Plants &gt; Insert Flaming 2 Plant**.
1. In the **Flamingo nXt Plant** dialog box, click a plant name, and click **Open**.
1. At the prompt, pick a location for your plant in the model.

## Notes
> Models with Flamingo 2 plants already inserted should work with some restrictions.
> Flamingo 2 plants are different from the new plants. Currently you cannot edit Flamingo 2 plants or convert them to Flamingo nXt plants.
