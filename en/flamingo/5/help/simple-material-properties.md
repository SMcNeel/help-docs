# Simple Material Properties
The Simple Material Properties dialog box give easy access to the properties you will usually want to change to make a material look different without changing the material style from, say Solid Color to Glass. For most materials, changing the color is all that is necessary to get a different look. You can change the advanced properties. These are pre-set by the material template to help you quickly achieve the appearance you want.{: #materialname}
{% include_relative snippets/snippet-nameandbasecolor.md %}
## Solid Color
{: #solid-color}
Solid Color materials have only a [name](advanced-material-properties-main.html#name) and a [color](advanced-material-properties-main.html#color).

### 
Properties available from the **Simple Material Properties** dialog box:

> [Name](advanced-material-properties-main.html#name) 
> [Color](advanced-material-properties-main.html#color) 

All other properties are set to a default (usually off or zero).

###  **Advanced** 
Opens the [Advanced Material Properties](advanced-material-properties-main.html) dialog box.

## Metal
{: #metal}
Metal materials have a highlight whose color matches the [color](advanced-material-properties-main.html#color). You can control the [Sharpness](advanced-material-properties-main.html#sharpness) of this highlight from the **Simple Material Properties** control.

> [Intensity](advanced-material-properties-main.html#intensity) 
> [Fresnel](advanced-material-properties-main.html#fresnel)

## Plastic
{: #plastic}
Plastic materials have a white [highlight](advanced-material-properties-main.html#highlight-color) set by the template.

###

> [Sharpness](advanced-material-properties-main.html#sharpness) 

###  **Advanced** 
Opens the [Advanced Material Properties](advanced-material-properties-main.html) dialog box.

## ClearFinish
{: #clearfinish}
The ClearFinish material simulates car paint, porcelain, ceramics, varnished woods, or any material with a plastic or clear-coat layer. ClearFinish uses the [Fresnel](advanced-material-properties-main.html#fresnel) setting to change the material color based on angle to the view. These materials tend to be a deep color when looked at straight on, but as the surface curves away from the view, they become more and more reflective. Car paints with a clear-coat or clear lacquer finishes are good examples.
